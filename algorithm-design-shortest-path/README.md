Shortest Path Algorithm

A simple Python program that finds the shortest path between nodes in a weighted graph using a step-by-step algorithm.

Features
    • Implements a shortest path algorithm using dictionaries and loops
    • Finds the shortest distance from a starting node to all other nodes
    • Displays the optimal path for each destination
    • Works with any weighted graph represented as a dictionary

How It Works

The program starts from a given node and iteratively updates the shortest known distance to each connected node. It keeps track of visited nodes and their shortest paths using dictionary comprehensions. The final output displays the shortest distance and the corresponding path from the start node to each target node.
